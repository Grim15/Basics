When initially using transferfrom function in ERC20 funds must be approved

approve(msg.sender, value being sent)

after transferfrom is executed it subtracts the approved amt from the allowance.

create a function that uses the contract address instead of the msg.sender in the approval() to modify the _allowance mapping which should allow the contract to interact with the funds being deposited.

call vs delegatecall - call changes the called contracts state variables mean while, delegate call changes the calling contracts state variables.
